# Aliens versus Predator 2 Auto Launcher (No CD required)
This batch script will launch your AvP 2 game without the CD at all.

Put the .bat file in your main AvP 2 directory, which is where the game is fully installed.
You will be able to launch the game without having the CD inserted afterwards.

This assumes that you have the game installed correctly!
